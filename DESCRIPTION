Description: A minimal set of routines to calculate the Grantham distance
    <doi:10.1126/science.185.4154.862>. The Grantham distance attempts to
    provide a proxy for the evolutionary distance between two amino acids
    based on three key chemical properties: composition, polarity and
    molecular volume. In turn, evolutionary distance is used as a proxy for
    the impact of missense mutations. The higher the distance, the more
    deleterious the substitution is expected to be.
